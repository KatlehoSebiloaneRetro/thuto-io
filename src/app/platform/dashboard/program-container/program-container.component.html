       <h2>What are programs</h2>
       <p>Picture Thuto as your child's magical piggy bank 
        for a brighter future. When you invest money into
         your child's Thuto account, it transforms into 
        Thuto Coins. These coins are like rewards your 
        child earns for doing well in their studies.
        
        Here's the cool part: Thuto is super smart. 
        Whether your child is acing everything or 
        putting in their best effort, they earn Thuto Coins.
        These coins show how they're growing and 
        learning. Plus, any leftover coins can be saved for 
        later or turned back into real money.
        
        So, by funding your child's Thuto account, you're 
        giving them a fun way to learn, grow, and save for
        the amazing future ahead!</p>
